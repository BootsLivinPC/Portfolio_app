        <p> 
         This was a group project I worked on at school.  
         I followed a wire frame that was provided for the layout. 
         My main tasks included Instagram API, Twitter API, YouTube embed, current Time/Date, daily topic and quotes components/database. 
        </p>
        <p>
         Even though we didn't finish it to the standards we had envisioned, I feel we all learned a lot. 
         Working together, as a team, presented itâ€™s own challenges: GitHub merge conflicts, coders being in different locations, differing levels of expertise and communication skills, etc.  With my restaurant management background, I found myself well-suited to take the lead within our team. 
         I made sure we had quick daily meetings or check-ins with team members to troubleshoot and brainstorm, all while keeping morale up, especially on workdays that were tough on us all.
        </p>

         There remains a few bugs to fix, like getting the Twitter Api to display.  Although I am finished with the class, I continue to work on these problems as a side project and will show my results to Dev Point Labs when I feel satisfied that it is finished.  My hope is that they will use this experience will benefit future coders in their classes.

         <p>This game was created with HTML, CSS and Javascript. It was great practice. 
            I am still learning the in's and out's of JavaScript but by doing this exercise I really start to see the power of this language to traverse and manipulate the DOM. </p>

       <p>I was asked to update an Adobe Flash business site. I followed the layout and style of the Flash site using React. Quickly I realized that for this kind of static site I could easily make it with just pure Javascript, CSS and HTML. So that will be my next project. This was a fun exercise in replicating a layout/style page.</p>
