I followed a wire frame that was provided for the layout. My main tasks included Instagram API, Twitter API, YouTube embed, current Time/Date, daily topic and quotes components/database. Even though we didn't finish it to the standards we had envisioned, I feel we all learned a lot. Working together, as a team, presented itâ€™s own challenges: GitHub merge conflicts, being in different locations, differing levels of expertise and communication skills, etc.  With my restaurant management background, I found myself well-suited to take the lead within our team. I made sure we had quick daily meetings or check-ins with team members to troubleshoot and brainstorm, all while keeping morale up, especially on workdays that were tough on us all.", "https://dpl-dashboard.herokuapp.com/")
